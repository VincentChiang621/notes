- 1. initialize q with root
- 2. while q not empty:
- 3a. traverse everything in q
- 3b. also adding cur.left and cur.right if applicable 
- 4. updates res with level

### Implement
‚û°Ô∏è See `solution.py` for the full implementation.  

### Review
- Walk through examples to verify correctness.  
- Debug as if a bug exists to confirm logic holds.  

### Evaluate
- **Time Complexity:** O(N)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(N)
