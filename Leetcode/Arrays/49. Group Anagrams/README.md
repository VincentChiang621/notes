## UMPIRE Method

### Understand
- Clarifying questions:
  - Input: List[str], output: List[List[str]]?
  - Can strings be empty? Should they still be grouped?
  - Is it okay to return the result in any order, or should I preserve input order?
  - test case: [apple, apo, poa, appel, opp] -> [[apple, appel], [apo, poa], [opp]]
  
- Naive Solution:
  - Use a hashmap to map sorted string to resulting string | hashmap[‚Äòaelpp‚Äô] = [‚Äòapple‚Äô]
  - Fill the whole hashmap and return all lists
  - S = avglen(strs)
  - We need to sort ALL strs, so O(n * Slog(S))
 

### Match
- Problem Type: **Array + Hashmap**  
- Strategies:
  - **Sorting**: ‚úÖ Useful, but we need to spend extra time + memory to sort every `strs[i]`
  - **Hashmap**: ‚úÖ Efficient for tuples() as charCounts -> list of corresponding anagrams 

### Plan
General idea:  
- We don‚Äôt need to sort every string because we can use charMap as a key to hashmap
- Since s[i] only contains lowercase letters, i can count ‚Äòabc‚Äô as (1,1,1,0,...,0) and ‚Äòcab‚Äô would be the same tuple
- Cut back on sorting time. 


### Implement
‚û°Ô∏è See `solution.py` for the full implementation.  

### Review
- Walk through examples to verify correctness.  
- Debug as if a bug exists to confirm logic holds.  

### Evaluate
- **Time Complexity:** O(N * S)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(N)
